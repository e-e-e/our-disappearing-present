				<h1>our disappearing present...</h1>
				<h2>coming soon / 05:05:2016</h2>
				<p>There are no profiles, no permanence and no images in this artist-run social media network that will exist parasitically across a number of websites. A prototype and a provisional statement towards what could be possible if social media had a different kind of politic. Our disappearing present channels Twitter and Snapchat, without the invasive commodification of your identity. Demonstrating a possible structure for our online world that sidesteps corporate control, this project is deliberately fleeting. </p>
				<p> our disappearing present... will premiere as part of <a href="http://www.nextwave.org.au">Next Wave Festival 2016</a>.</p>
				<p>Our disappearing present was developed for Next Wave Festival 2016, and has been supported by The Margaret Lawrence Bequest.</p>
